# Maintenance Registration System

## Introduction
The Maintenance Registration System is a software solution designed to facilitate the scheduling and logging of maintenance tasks for PCs and machines within an organization. This README serves as a guide for programmers who will be involved in the development, implementation, or maintenance of the system.

## Features
- **Maintenance Scheduling**: Programmers can implement scheduling functionalities to allow users to schedule maintenance tasks based on predefined criteria.
- **Logging System**: Implementation of a logging system to record all maintenance activities, providing a comprehensive maintenance history for each device.
- **Notification System**: Integration with Home Assistant UI OS to deliver automated notifications to users when maintenance is due for specific devices.
