# Maintenance Registration System

## Introduction
The Maintenance Registration System is a software solution designed to facilitate the scheduling and logging of maintenance tasks for PCs and machines within an organization. This README serves as a guide for programmers who will be involved in the development, implementation, or maintenance of the system.

## Features
- **Maintenance Scheduling**: Programmers can implement scheduling functionalities to allow users to schedule maintenance tasks based on predefined criteria.
- **Logging System**: Implementation of a logging system to record all maintenance activities, providing a comprehensive maintenance history for each device.
- **Notification System**: Integration with Home Assistant UI to deliver automated notifications to users when maintenance is due for specific devices.

## Usage
For programmers contributing to the development of the Maintenance Registration System, here's a brief overview of the key components and functionalities:

1. **Scheduling Maintenance Tasks**:
   - Implement backend logic and database structures to enable users to schedule maintenance tasks.
   - Develop API for inputting scheduling details and confirming maintenance tasks from the homeassistant UI.

2. **Logging Maintenance Activities**:
   - Implement functionality to record maintenance activities in the system database.
   - Develop interfaces for viewing and managing maintenance logs(homeassistant UI).

3. **Notifications**:
   - Integrate the system with Home Assistant UI to enable automated notifications.
   - Implement logic for generating and sending notifications when maintenance is due for tablets in each room.
